## Info

Ticket Assister (stylized TkAst) optimizes your workflow with TeamDynamix (TDX) tickets by setting defaults, filling out forms, and consolidating information.
It reduces your cognitive load so that you can focus on getting work done accurately and efficiently.

It has many features, all of which can be toggled on and off in the Options page.

## Building/Deployment

0. Install deps

    - install `npm`
    - `npm install` project dependencies

1. Make sure that `package.json` and `manifest.json` have their version numbers bumped

    - Extension web stores will reject the build if it is the same version number as the current uploaded version

2. `npm run build`

    - This will build for production, i.e. for URLs at https://help.uillinois.edu/TDNext/*
        - To build for development, run `npm run build:dev`

    - This will generate files in the `build/` directory
        - As a side effect, all previous files in the `build` directory will be removed
    
    - Two main scripts are ran in this command:
        1. `vite build`
            - this builds the pages, e.g. the Options page and the default popup (index) page
        2. `node buildContentScripts.mjs`
            - this builds each of the content scripts
            - each script is packaged as an IIFE to allow turning the features on and off at runtime

3. Zip the output files

    1. Zip all of the files from the `build/` directory.
    *Do not zip the `build` directory in itself. Only the contents.*

    2. Name the zipped file
    
        - For Chrome, `YYYYMMDD_tkast_X.Y.Z.zip`
        - `YYYYMMDD` is the current date (which the files were built)
        - `X.Y.Z` is the version number

    3. Save the zip file in the `releases/` directory

        - This directory is ignored from source control

4. Upload package to the relevant extension store

    - Upload the zip file and Submit for Review

### Automated Deployment

This resository can deploy automatically to the Chrome Web store. 

> To deploy automatically to the Chrome Web Store, push a tag to the `main` branch.

As of September of 2023, this repository is configured to continue to deploy under the original 'Alpo' developer account. This may change in the future.

To allow automatic deployment to the Chrome Web Store, add a GitHub repository variable `CHROME_ITEM_ID` with the ID of the Chrome plugin; 
and a GitHub repository secret `CHROME_TOKEN` set to a Chrome Webstore API key auth token.

See [Using the Webstore API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/using_webstore_api/) for guidance on creating the auth token.

## Testing

### Automatic testing

Run unit tests with `npm run test`

- This verifies that all of the content scripts ("rules") are properly associated
- This runs basic tests on helper functions
- These tests are not yet comprehensive, i.e., they do not include integration tests

### Manual testing

To install locally and manually test the extension, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md#manual-testing)
